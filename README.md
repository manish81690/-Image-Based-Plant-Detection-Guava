# -Image-Based-Plant-Detection-Guava
The project involves the use of Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning for building a model that will detect disease for  Guava Leaves. A detailed Comparative analysis of different pre-trained models was carried out along with detailed study on  InceptionV3 model to boost results for the detection.
